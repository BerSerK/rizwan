Solve ODE Boundary Value Problem, using MATLAB bvp5c build-in function
#########
A simple MATLAB script for a Pakistan friend. Key thought:
1. It's a dual solution problem with a parameter L. We need to make a good initial guess for it.
2. As the parameter L, mentioned in 1, varing, we use the previous solution as the initial guess for the next value of L.
